## Submission Details

As usual, prior to submitting your assignment to Blackboard, be sure that you have committed and pushed your final changes to GitHub. Submit the URL of your assignment _repository_ (i.e., _not_ the URL of the pull request) as a Link Resource in Blackboard. Please note: the timestamp of the submission on Blackboard is used to assess any late penalties if and when warranted.

### Due Date

Your Teams submission is due by 11:59 PM, ....

### Grading Rubric

This assignment is worth **5 points**.

Criteria          | Exceeds Expectations         | Meets Expectations                  | Below Expectations                  | Failure                                                 |

Pull Request (20%)| Submitted early, correct url | Submitted on-time; correct url      | Incorrect URL                       | No pull request was created or submitted                |
Code Style (20%)  | Exemplary code style         | Consistent, modern coding style     | Inconsistent coding style           | No style whatsoever or no code changes present          |
Correctness^ (60%)| All unit tests pass          | At least 80% of the unit tests pass | At least 60% of the unit tests pass | Less than 50% of the unit tests pass                    |

^ _The Google Test unit runner, if appropriate, will calculate the correctness points based purely on the fraction of tests passed_.
